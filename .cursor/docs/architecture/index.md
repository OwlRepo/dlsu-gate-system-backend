# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural decisions.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document important architectural decisions, the context in which they were made, and the consequences of those decisions.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```markdown
# {Decision ID}: {Title}

**Status:** {proposed|accepted|deprecated|superseded}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Context

## Decision
What decision was made?

## Consequences
- Positive consequences
- Negative consequences
- Risks and mitigations
```

## Current ADRs
